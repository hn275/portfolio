              <span>Hello ðŸ‘‹!</span>
              <p>
                I'm in my final year as a Computer Science student at University
                of Victoria, with a strong focus on Networking and Information
                Security. Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm deeply passionate
                about Cryptography, Linux, and Free and Open Source Software.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey through the tech industry has led me to roles at
                various startups and freelancing opportunities, where I've
                authored code as a full-stack software developer. These
                experiences have introduced me to the modern web technologies,
                and standard security practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Motivated to learn, I constantly seek to leverage my skills and
                expertise to contribute meaningfully to the realms of
                cybersecurity and open-source innovation.
