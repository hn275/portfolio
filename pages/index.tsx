            <p>
              I am a recent grad year as a Computer Science student at
              University of Victoria, with a strong focus on Networking and
              Information Security. Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm deeply
              passionate about Cryptography, Linux, and Free and Open Source
              Software.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey through the tech industry has led me to roles at
              various startups and freelancing opportunities, where I've
              authored code as a full-stack software developer. These
              experiences have introduced me to the modern web technologies, and
              standard security practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Motivated to learn, I constantly seek to leverage my skills and
              expertise to contribute meaningfully to the realms of
              cybersecurity and open-source innovation.
