        Collabify allows users to easily share their availability with others
        and receive text notifications if an event is created. Users can opt in
        for a private group that requires a password to access and to share
        their availability, authentication is done with JSON Web Token. This app
        is great for coordinating schedules and planning events with friends,
        family, or colleagues.

        I&apos;m greatful to be selected by the project manager to lead a team
        of 4. Within the months of the Winter semester, we&apos;ve managed to
        pass all of our courses, and to have a MVP hosted!
