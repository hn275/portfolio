        <span class="font-bold text-xl">Hello ðŸ‘‹!</span>
		<p>
			I'm a 4<sup>th</sup> year Computer Science student at University of Victoria,
			with a strong focus on <span class="font-bold">Networking</span> and
			<span class="font-bold">Security</span>. Beyond my academic
			pursuits, I'm deeply passionate about Cryptography, Linux, and Free
			and Open Source Software (FOSS).
		</p>
		<p>
			My journey through the tech industry has led me to roles at various
			startups and freelancing opportunities, where I've authored code as
			a <span class="font-bold italic">full-stack software developer</span
			>. These experiences have introduced me to the modern web
			technologies, and standard security practices.
		</p>
		<p>
			Motivated to learn, I constantly seek to leverage my skills and
			expertise to contribute meaningfully to the realms of cybersecurity
			and open-source innovation.
